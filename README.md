<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a>

Steps-(Run the commands in Command Prompt with Admin Priveleges)

1)pip install youtube-dl
2)youtube-dl -u "xxxxxx@gmail.com" -p "xxxxxxx" URLofYourCourse(Content Page)
 For Example- 
 youtube-dl -u "1234@gmail.com" -p "1234pass" https://www.udemy.com/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/learn/v4/content
 
3)Note- Before running the commands, change the directory in Command Prompt to where you want to download the videos. Then run command in Step 2.

*Note- I was facing frequent failures, so I made a batch file and put it on repeat. 
That code can be found in repeat.bat
